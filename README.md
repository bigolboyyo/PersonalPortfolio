Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio site! You can check out the live version at [wesleygrant.netlify.app](https://wesleygrant.netlify.app/).

This portfolio site showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. It's built using the following tech stack:

- **[Frontend](https://github.com/bigolboyyo/PersonalPortfolio/tree/main/frontend)**: React, Material-UI, and GSAP
- **[Backend](https://github.com/bigolboyyo/PersonalPortfolio/tree/main/backend)**: Flask and SendGrid

The site is deployed using Netlify for the frontend and PythonAnywhere for the backend.

For more detailed information on the frontend and backend, please refer to the respective README files in their respective folders.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies for both frontend and backend.
