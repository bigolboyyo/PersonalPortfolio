# Frontend - Wesley Grant's Personal Portfolio Site

<img src="../frontend/public/images/casette.png" alt="Casette" width="300" height="200">

This is the frontend part of my personal portfolio site, built using React, Material-UI, and GSAP for animations. The site follows a "90s space" theme and features a responsive design with custom style overrides.

## Features

- Four routes using React Router:
  - Home
  - Skills
  - Work
  - Contact
- Various GSAP animations for page transitions and interactive elements
- Extensive use of React hooks for state management and side effects
- Material-UI components with custom style overrides
- Netlify deployment

## Getting Started

To set up and run the frontend locally, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should now see the frontend running on your local machine!

**Note**: If you are running the backend locally, make sure to update the frontend fetch to point to your localhost.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out or open an issue on the repository.
